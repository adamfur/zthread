   * @version 2.2.1
   *
   * A Barrier is a Waitable object that serves as synchronization points for 
   * a set of threads. A Barrier is constructed for a fixed number (<i>N</i>) of threads.
   * Threads attempting to wait() on a Barrier (<i> 1 - N</i>) will block until the <i>N</i>th
   * thread arrives. The <i>N</i>th thread will awaken all the the others.
   * 
   * An optional Runnable command may be associated with the Barrier. This will be run()
   * when the <i>N</i>th thread arrives and Barrier is not broken.
   *
   * <b>Error Checking</b>
   *
   * A Barrier uses an all-or-nothing. All threads involved must successfully 
   * meet at Barrier. If any one of those threads leaves before all the threads 
   * have (as the result of an error or exception) then all threads present at 
   * the Barrier will throw BrokenBarrier_Exception.
   *
   * A broken Barrier will cause all threads attempting to wait() on it to 
   * throw a BrokenBarrier_Exception.
   *
   * A Barrier will remain 'broken', until it is manually reset().
