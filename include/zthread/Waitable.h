   *
   * The Waitable interface defines a common method of adding general <i>wait</i> semantics
   * to an object. This is simply defined as waiting for some condition to occur,
   * however the definition of that conditon is fluid in that it is left to
   * specialization of this class to define.
   * 
   * The following text describes the specific meaning of <i>wait</i> semantics in more detail. 
   *
   * <b>Waiting</b>
   *
   * An object implementng the Waitable interface externalizes a mechanism for testing
   * some internal condition. Another object may <i>wait()</i>s for a Waitable object; 
   * in doing so, it wait()s for that condition to become true by blocking the caller 
   * while the condition is false.
   *
   * Waitable objects may <b>never</b> <i>wait</i> for themselves. For example, 
   * an Waitable object that calls its own wait() method in its constructor or 
   * destructor would be considered to be waiting for itself. This may or may not lead 
   * to deadlock (depending on how an object extends <i>wait</i> semantics), but it should 
   * never be neccessary. A Waitable object is already privy to the condition it is 
   * exposing a waiting mechanism for; in other words, the information is already available
   * within the object so it does not need to wait.
   *
   * Other than the previous rule, Waiting semantics do <i>not</i> neccessarily provide 
   * any garuntees regarding nor does it place any restrictions on thread safety, 
   * preconditions, postconditions or even what constitutes the condition being wait()ed for
   * or how a wait() is accomplised. It merly establishes the base for framework of more specialized
   * meanings for <i>wait</i>.
   *
   * The details of these semantics are refined further by specializaions of this 
   * class, but the general conotation remains intact. 
   *
   * For example, a Condition is Waitable object that extends <i>wait</i> semantics
   * so that wait()ing means a thread is blocked until some external stimulus 
   * specifically performs an operation on the Condition to make its internal condition true. 
   * (serialization aside)
   *
   * A Future extends <i>wait</i> semantics so that wait()ing means that a task completed 
   * somewhere and that some action be taken prior to the wait.
   *
   * A Barrier extends <i>wait</i> semantics so that wait()ing mean waiting for other 
   * waiters, and may include automatically resetting the condition once a wait is complete.
   *
   * Combining the Cancelable interface with the Waitable interface creates a method 
   * wait for an Excutor to complete its responisiblities, executing, which really means waiting 
   * for a number of things all at once.

     * is thrown.
     *
     * The semantics for how and when a Waitable object decides to release a 
     * blocked thread are particular to each specialization of this class. The
     * Waitable interface itself does not imply any garuntees about the state 
     * of the environment (serial or otherwise); however specializations of
     * this interface may do so.
