Thanks to everyone who provided feedback and found this library useful.
There were quite a few people who did point out bugs, or came up with
good suggestions. All helped me improve the library. Thanks

Thanks for everyone who helped me update the autoconf/automake tools
over time. That was very helpful & taught me quite a bit.
